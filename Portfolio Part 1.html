                <p>Hi! My name is Ernest Cheung, I am 17 years old, and I am currently a junior at Make School. My hobbies include drawing, playing piano, and recently, coding! I am a creator; I love creating things that I can be proud of and call my own. In the future, I hope to collaborate with other creators like myself and build things that can shine a brighter light on the world.</p>
